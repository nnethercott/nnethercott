## Hi there 👋


I'm a Master's student from Canada currently at `Politecnico di Milano` (Milan, IT) following studies in Mathematical Engineering, with emphasis on Statistical and Machine Learning.  Before this I completed my bachelor's degree at `Queen's University` (Kingston, CAN) in the field of Engineering Mathematics and Applied Mechanics. 

Some stuff ab me...
* 🐙 I have tentative plans to do that whole Medium data science article writing bit
* 🥑 Currently curating an Angel Olsen essentials playlist
* 🌀 Read through all of Sally Rooney's books at a blistering pace
* 😌 Plan on returning to Canada as the pretentious guy who studied abroad
