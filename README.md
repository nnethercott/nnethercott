### Hi there 👋

I'm currently a Master's student at `Politecnico di Milano` (Milan, IT) following studies in mathematical engineering with specialization in statistical and machine learning.  Before this I completed my bachelor's degree at `Queen's University` (Kingston, CA) in the field of engineering mathematics and applied mechanics.
